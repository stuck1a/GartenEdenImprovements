# GartenEdenImprovements
Project Zomboid General Content Mod for the GartenEden project

## Current State
WIP [22-12-03]

## Note
This is no mod for the general public. It's designed as part of a server project and therefore part of a mod pack.
Feel free to use any parts of it as you like, but don't except the mod to work flawlessly within your server. It might be or might not be.

## Special thanks
